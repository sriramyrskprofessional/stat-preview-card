## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Linear gradients
- Desktop-first workflow
- Scss



### What I learned

I learned how to display a transparent color over an image using linear gradient
I also learned that to many containers are not required , When all the elements are in same dimension we don't need containers.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
img{background: linear-gradient(to top,$Soft-violet-trans 100%,transparent) ,url("images/image-header-desktop.jpg");}
 
```
```scss
$Soft-violet-trans:rgba(108, 12, 168, 0.486);
```



### Continued development

I want to focus on writing clean code by reducing any unwanted codes.
